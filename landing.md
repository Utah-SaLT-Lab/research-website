		<p>"I am an Assistant Professor in Kahlert School of Computing at University of Utah. My research focuses on the security and safety of AI-enabled systems, aiming to empower system providers and individual users to counteract attacks. I am broadly interested in a range of topics in security and privacy relating to machine learning, including adversarial generative AI, security/privacy of LLM agents, and machine learning for security. My projects are consistently published in conferences such as IEEE S&P / USENIX Security / CCS / NDSS, NeurIPS / ICML / ICLR / CVPR, and ICSE / FSE. I am a recipient of Maurice H. Halstead Memorial Award (2023), ECCV AROW Workshop Best Paper Award (2022), and ACM SIGPLAN Distinguished Paper Award (2019)."</p>
		<p> I obtained my Ph.D. from Purdue University under the supervision of Dr. Xiangyu Zhang. I received my bachelor’s degree from Zhejiang University.
		<p/>
		<p>I am looking for students interested in security and privacy at the intersection of machine learning and traditional systems. If you have a relevant background and are interested in this research direction, please email me with your CV and transcripts.</p>
